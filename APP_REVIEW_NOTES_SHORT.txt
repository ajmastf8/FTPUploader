APP REVIEW NOTES - FTP Downloader

TESTING WITH DEMO MODE (No FTP Server Required)
════════════════════════════════════════════════

FTP Downloader includes built-in demo mode for easy testing.

QUICK TEST (6 Steps):

1. LAUNCH APP - Demo Configuration tab appears automatically

2. VIEW DEMO CONFIG - Click ⚙️ (gear icon)
   • LOOK FOR: Orange banner "Demo Mode - cannot be edited"
   • All fields disabled (grayed out) - intentional design
   • Shows: demo.example.com, demo_user, port 21

3. TEST CONNECTION - Click "Test Connection" button
   • Result: ✅ "Demo connection successful! (Simulated)"

4. START SESSION - Click "Start" button
   • Status: "Not Connected" → "Connecting" → "Connected"
   • Watch metrics update: file counts, files/min, MB/s
   • Notification feed shows simulated downloads

5. VIEW LOGS - Click "Live Logs" button
   • Separate window with color-coded operation logs

6. STOP SESSION - Click "Stop" button
   • Returns to "Not Connected" instantly (no freeze)

WHAT TO VERIFY:
✅ Orange demo banner visible in config view
✅ All demo fields disabled (read-only)
✅ Real-time metrics during session
✅ Notifications appear with timestamps
✅ Stop button responds instantly
✅ "Save Changes" disabled in demo config

════════════════════════════════════════════════

OPTIONAL: TEST REAL FTP

If you have FTP server access:
1. Click "New Configuration"
2. Enter server/credentials
3. Click "Test Connection" (verifies real connection)
4. Select local download folder (grants file permissions)
5. Click "Browse FTP" to pick remote directories
6. Click "Create Configuration" and "Start"

════════════════════════════════════════════════

PRIVACY & PERMISSIONS

Required Permissions:
• Network - FTP connections
• File System - Download folder (user grants)
• Keychain - Secure password storage

Privacy Commitment:
✅ NO data collection, analytics, or telemetry
✅ ALL data stored locally only
✅ Direct FTP connections (no proxy/relay)
✅ NO third-party sharing

════════════════════════════════════════════════

KNOWN BEHAVIORS (Not Bugs)

• Demo config READ-ONLY by design (prevents confusion)
• Demo not saved to disk (recreated each session)
• Stop button instant (fixed previous deadlock issue)
• Metrics exclude idle time (active download time only)
• Simulated data appears perfect (real has variance)

════════════════════════════════════════════════
